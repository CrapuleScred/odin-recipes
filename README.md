Project HTML TOP

This is the ending project for the HTML section.
The point is to work on all knowledge we worked on and restitue it on a recipes webpage with index, links, img etc...
Practicing is the key.

edit: not many commit because i worked on two differents computers. 
I need to check again all that git lesson because it seems to be difficult for me to understand all.
Stick to the html lesson for that project.
